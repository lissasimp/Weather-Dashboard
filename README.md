# Server-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your Challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.


## User Story

- **AS** a traveler
- **I WANT** to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- **SO THAT** I can plan a trip accordingly


## Acceptance Criteria

- **WHEN** viewing weather dashboard
- **THEN** the user is presented with form inputs
- **WHEN** a user searches for a city
- **THEN** they are presented with current and future conditions for that city; the city is added to local storage and a button is dynamically created.
- **WHEN** a user views the current weather conditions for that city 
- **THEN** they are presented with: the city name; the date; an icon representation of weather conditions; the temperature; the humidity; the wind speed
- **WHEN** a user views future weather conditions for that city
- **THEN** they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:the date; an icon representation of weather conditions; the temperature; the humidity; the wind speed
- **WHEN**  a user clicks on dynamically created button
- **THEN** they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
